# SC_Canonical

SC_Canonical is a Magento Commerce plugin to enable canonical URL that fix the issue of the [FME_Canonical plugin](http://www.fmeaddons.com/magento/seo-canonical-url-extension.html).

It enables you to select tge preferred canonical URL for products. A drop down for canonical Meta Tag is added to each product page Meta Settings which shows all the possible variations of a particular URL. You can select the desired canonical Magento URL from this drop down and this URL will then be added to the head section of that particular page as a canonical Meta tag.

In case you do not prefer setting it manually, SC_Canonical will select for you the longest URL (quite always the deepest one) as a canonical link.
